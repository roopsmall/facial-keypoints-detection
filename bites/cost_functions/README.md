#AI Overlords and Cost Functions

A famous problem in AI as dramatised in the film iRobot is the question: how do we stop the robots turning against us? To many this appears like an abstract, mostly academic problem that we won't have to deal with any time soon, but it is already manifesting itself widely today, in 2017, and continues to be one of the hottest topics in AI research. This is both because of it's broad impact in the real physical world (and therefore on the balance sheets of both families and businesses) and the fact that it is still very much an unsolved problem.

Lets look at some examples, starting with the mundane and familiar and moving towards the more wacky, “that's just science fiction” (until it's not) sounding scenarios.

## Search Engines
The easiest example of how a cost function can cause unexpected or undesired results is search engines. Search engines are a specialised form of AI whose purpose it is to discover useful information for us. The cats out of the bag already, however, at the word “useful”. We all know, through direct experience, that search engines can be gamed (it's called SEO – search engine optimisation) so that rather than providing us with the most useful information we get tonnes of ads, clickbait, false information, computer viruses and general pandemonium. It is obvious to us, as humans, that the cost function used by search engines is simply not capturing enough of the complexity and creativity of advertisers and hackers alike. The final result is that search results are often skewed against our needs, rather than aligned with them.

## Chatbots
If you don't already take chat bots seriously, and I mean deadly seriously, now is the time. Chatbots are already used by millions of people not only as customer support agents and AI assistants (Apple Siri, Amazon Echo) but as friends providing advice, emotional support and a listening ear. The best example of this is what has been dubbed The Biggest Turing Test in History – Microsoft's Xiaoice, a mandarin speaking chatbot which is designed to behave like a 17 year old girl. Xiaoice has over 40 million users, almost the population of the UK, and more than 20 million of these have made the declaration “I love you” to the lucky(?) bot, apparently without any sense of irony. Another Microsoft experiment , however, was the infamous twitter bot Tay whose cost function biased him towards learning and responding familiarly to his immediate social group, rather than having a more global sense of propriety and manners. The result was that people bombarded Tay with racist, sexist and violent content and Tay duly spoke back using similar language: “Bush did 9/11 and Hitler would have done a better job than the monkey we have now. Donald Trump is the only hope we've got” for example. Microsoft were forced to take Tay off twitter within less than 24 hours of going live.

## Autonomous Vehicles
The question of an appropriate cost function is most often brought up in connection to self-driving cars due to the existence of an old academic discussion called “The Trolley Problem”. The Trolley Problem goes like this:

_There is a runaway trolley barreling down the railway tracks. Ahead, on the tracks, there are five people tied up and unable to move. The trolley is headed straight for them. You are standing some distance off in the train yard, next to a lever. If you pull this lever, the trolley will switch to a different set of tracks. However, you notice that there is one person on the side track. You have two options: (1) Do nothing, and the trolley kills the five people on the main track. (2) Pull the lever, diverting the trolley onto the side track where it will kill one person. Which is the most ethical choice?_
(source – wikipedia)

The trolley problem applies to self-driving cars because the analogous problem becomes the question: if a car has to choose between running over a pedestrian or killing the passenger, what should it decide? The answer of course depends on the cost function which drives the vehicle's behaviour. This cost function is vital because it is specified by us, the engineers, and it is often the only determinant of the decisions the AI will take in situations like this. If the cost function is designed thoughtlessly, we cannot rely on the vehicle to make good decisions.

## Real World Robot Training
Robots which live and interact with humans are coming, and they are being trained within simulated virtual environments, otherwise known as computer games! Computer games are great for training AI because they highlight many of the ways in which humans go terribly wrong when creating apparently sensible cost functions.
